Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Full Stack JavaScript Developer with a diverse skill set and a strong foundation in various programming languages and tools. I recently completed my Full Stack JavaScript studies at a vocational training school, where I honed my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies. I am currently expanding my knowledge through Python courses at Code Academy.
